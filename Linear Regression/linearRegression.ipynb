      "In the previous sections, we have selected the linear regression weights by maximising the likelihood of the data. The learnt model certainly makes useful predictions, but it provides no notion of uncertainty: we cannot distinguish between a prediction that is tightly constrained by the data, and a prediction that is essentially an unconstrained \\`guess'. Also, if there are multiple likely explanations of the data, we have neglected all but one. Recall that for a given feature mapping $\\X \\to \\Xf$, the predictive behaviour of a linear regression is encoded in the weights:\n",
      "\\begin{equation}\n",
      "f(x) = \\Xf \\W \n",
      "\\end{equation}\n",

      "Where $\\W$ is $p \\times 1$ and $\\Xf$ is $n \\times p$. Instead of using a single *maximum likelihood* weight vector, we can take a Bayesian approach and consider a probability distribution over all possible weight vectors.  The distribution can be inferred from the observations using Bayes rule:\n",
      "\n",

      "In addition, we must now specify a prior distribution over $\\W$ encoding our belief about reasonable weight values. Any probability distribution we consider to be sensible for the problem could be used here, but some are easier to work with than others. In this tutorial, we will use a simple Gaussian prior with precision (inverse covariance) $\\weightprecsimp$ that is $p \\times p$ with a single free parameter:\n",

To do this we must look at the *joint* multivariate distribution of the posterior. Note that given our particular choice of Gaussian prior and likelihood, the posterior predictions are also joint-Gaussian. For example, we can compute a posterior multivariate Gaussian over the weights and draw random weights out of this distribution. This will sample a set of deterministic models each drawn with probability consistent with our Bayesian analysis.\n",

Such manual selection is not ideal, as it requires a deep understanding of every dataset and large amounts of manual tuning to select appropriate noise and prior hyperparameters. Instead, there are two main approaches for hyperparameter selection based on the data. Both rely on the concept of *marginal likelihood* - the probability of drawing the observations out of the prior. We can obtain this criterion by marginalising over the actual weight vectors and the noise draws. The log marginal likelihood given all our Gausianity assumptions so far is given by:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\begin{equation}\n",

Here $|A|$ is the determinant of $A$, and $\\mu^*$ and $\\y^*$ are the mean weights and mean latent function predictions at $\\X$ respectively using the current hyperparameters. This criterion naturally weights model fit against complexity. If the prior is too tight to fit the data, we cannot draw the observations, but if it is too general then the probability of drawing any particular dataset is also low. It can become very small or large and is best computed in log form.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first hyperparameter strategy is to define a *hyper-prior* over $\\alphs$ and $\\mathbf{\\beta}$. If we carefully choose a conjugate prior (for our scenario this will be an inverse gamma distribution) over these parameters, then it is possible to marginalise over the hyperparameters (in the same way we marginalised the weights out of the predictive distribution) and obtain a closed form solution for the weight distribution. An interested student is directed to the above textbook for a detailed explanation.  Unfortunately, this distribution will be of Student-T form rather than Gaussian, so marginalising out the weights to obtain predictions will then be an exercise in numerical integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "A simpler approach that we will take here is to search for the maximum likelihood hyperparameters - this is also called the evidence approximation or type 2 maximum likelihood. The main drawback of this approach is that we loose a level of Bayesian inference compared to the above alternative. Also we must select these parameters via optimisation strategies and the problem is non-convex, meaning we may end up in a local optimum that is better than its neighbours but not the best set of parameters. However, it is a more principled method of model selection than manual tweaking.\n",
