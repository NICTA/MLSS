      "#Clustering\n",
      "Clustering is one of the oldest data exploration methods. The objective is for an algorithm to discover sets of similar points, or observations, within a larger dataset. These sets are called *clusters*.  Similarity is almost always characterised by some distance function between observations, such as Euclidean $\\ell_2$. Some of the more simple algorithms require the number of clusters to be specified in advance, while others can also infer this from the data, usually given other assumptions. K-means <cite data-cite=\"MacQueen1967\">(MacQueen,1967)</cite> was one of the first and still most popular algorithms designed for this task."
