      "Regression and classification are very useful for when we have some targets/labels for training, however, what about situations where we do not have targets/labels? This is where unsupervised methods such as dimensionality reduction and clustering can help us out but trying to infer categories from the data (clustering) or a low dimensional representation from the data (dimensionality reduction). We have already seen a simple dimensionality reduction technique, PCA, in the first tutorial. In this tutorial we will look at some clustering algorithms and a latent variable model that can be both interpreted as clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",

These sets are called *clusters*.  Similarity is almost always characterised by some distance function between observations, such as Euclidean $\\ell_2$. Some of the more simple algorithms require the number of clusters to be specified in advance, while others can also infer this from the data, usually given other assumptions. K-means was one of the first and still most popular algorithms designed for this task."

This algorithm is very fast in practice though. Another disadvantage is that the number of clusters, $K$, has to be specified in advance. Perhaps more of a concern is that clusters are assumed to be essentially spherical in shape because of the Euclidean distance used, which is quite often an over-simplification.

Some popular penalties are the [Akaike information criterion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion) and the [Bayesian information criterion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion). These criterion tend to under-penalise model complexity, and are sometimes computationally costly to calculate. Another way to choose $K$ is to use a fully Bayesian treatment, where we place prior distributions on the parameters (e.g. mean, covariance and weights), and then optimise the [log *marginal* likelihood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_likelihood) of the model, which also naturally incorporates a penalty for complexity. In the case of mixture models, the Bayesian learning algorithms can have very little additional computational cost compared to EM.

These topics are essentially the low-dimensional representation of documents learned by topic models. \n",

This is called a *bag of words* model, because order of the words is assumed unimportant. This simplifying assumption is known as the exchangeability assumption. \n",

What is nice is that the clusters/topics are *shared* over all documents. This enables us to view these topic/cluster weights, $\\wgtind_j$ as a low-dimensional description of the original document, i.e. a mixture of topics!\n",

For example, it is not effective in choosing the number of topics ($K$), and the symmetric Dirichlet prior over topic weights, has been found to be too restrictive. Hierarchical Dirichlet processes (Teh, 2006) have been developed to overcome both of these issues (but is beyond the scope of this tutorial)."
