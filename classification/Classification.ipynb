The location of the plane in the input space is selected based on a set of training examples labelled with a binary variable. To query the label of a new point, the algorithms simply determines on which side of the plane the point sits. In two dimensions, this amounts to dividing the input space into two sections with a straight line. In higher dimensions, the division is determined by a plane (or hyperplane in 4 or more dimensions). In general, we refer to SVMs as using a separating hyperplane in any dimension.\n",
