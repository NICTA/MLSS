  abstract = {A random process called the Dirichlet process whose sample functions
	are almost surely probability measures has been proposed by Ferguson
	as an approach to analyzing nonparametric problems from a Bayesian
	viewpoint. An important result obtained by Ferguson in this approach
	is that if observations are made on a random variable whose distribution
	is a random sample function of a Dirichlet process, then the conditional
	distribution of the random measure can be easily calculated, and
	is again a Dirichlet process. This paper extends Ferguson's result
	to cases where the random measure is a mixing distribution for a
	parameter which determines the distribution from which observations
	are made. The conditional distribution of the random measure, given
	the observations, is no longer that of a simple Dirichlet process,
	but can be described as being a mixture of Dirichlet processes. This
	paper gives a formal definition for these mixtures and develops several
	theorems about their properties, the most important of which is a
	closure property for such mixtures. Formulas for computing the conditional
	distribution are derived and applications to problems in bio-assay,
	discrimination, regression, and mixing distributions are given.},

	Bayesian and relies on the estimation of the posterior distribution

  abstract = {This paper applies a robust statistical scheme to the problem of unsupervised
	learning of high-dimensional data. We develop, analyze, and apply
	a new finite mixture model based on a generalization of the Dirichlet
	distribution. The generalized Dirichlet distribution has a more general
	covariance structure than the Dirichlet distribution and offers high
	flexibility and ease of use for the approximation of both symmetric
	and asymmetric distributions. We show that the mathematical properties
	of this distribution allow high-dimensional modeling without requiring
	dimensionality reduction and, thus, without a loss of information.
	This makes the generalized Dirichlet distribution more practical
	and useful. We propose a hybrid stochastic expectation maximization
	algorithm (HSEM) to estimate the parameters of the generalized Dirichlet
	mixture. The algorithm is called stochastic because it contains a
	step in which the data elements are assigned randomly to components
	in order to avoid convergence to a saddle point. The adjective "hybrid"
	is justified by the introduction of a Newton-Raphson step. Moreover,
	the HSEM algorithm autonomously selects the number of components
	by the introduction of an agglomerative term. The performance of
	our method is tested by the classification of several pattern-recognition
	data sets. The generalized Dirichlet mixture is also applied to the
	problems of image restoration, image object recognition and texture
	image database summarization for efficient retrieval. For the texture
	image summarization problem, results are reported for the Vistex
	texture image database from the MIT Media Lab.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an incremental method for model selection
	and learning of Gaussian mixtures based on the recently proposed
	variational Bayes approach. The method adds components to the mixture
	using a Bayesian splitting test procedure: a component is split into
	two components and then variational update equations are applied
	only to the parameters of the two components. As a result, either
	both components are retained in the model or one of them is found
	to be redundant and is eliminated from the model. In our approach,
	the model selection problem is treated locally, in a region of the
	data space, so we can set more informative priors based on the local
	data distribution. A modified Bayesian mixture model is presented
	to implement this approach, along with a learning algorithm that
	iteratively applies a splitting test on each mixture component. Experimental
	results and comparisons with two other techniques testify for the
	adequacy of the proposed approach.},

	places based on their appearance. The system we present is not limited
	to localization, but can determine that a new observation comes from
	a previously unseen place, and so augment its map. Effectively this
	is a SLAM system in the space of appearance. Our probabilistic approach
	allows us to explicitly account for perceptual aliasing in the environment--identical
	but indistinctive observations receive a low probability of having
	come from the same place. We achieve this by learning a generative
	model of place appearance. By partitioning the learning problem into
	two parts, new place models can be learned online from only a single
	observation of a place. The algorithm complexity is linear in the
	number of places in the map, and is particularly suitable for online
	loop closure detection in mobile robotics.},

	to a given bayesian model is a challenging problem. Conjugate priors
	can be selected for simplicity motivations. However, conjugate priors
	can be too restrictive to accurately model the available prior information.
	This paper studies a new generative supervised classifier which assumes
	that the parameter prior distributions conditioned on each class
	are mixtures of Dirichlet processes. The motivations for using mixtures
	of Dirichlet processes is their known ability to model accurately
	a large class of probability distributions. A Monte Carlo method
	allowing one to sample according to the resulting class-conditional
	posterior distributions is then studied. The parameters appearing
	in the class-conditional densities can then be estimated using these
	generated samples (following bayesian learning). The proposed supervised
	classifier is applied to the classification of altimetric waveforms
	backscattered from different surfaces (oceans, ices, forests, and
	deserts). This classification is a first step before developing tools
	allowing for the extraction of useful geophysical information from
	altimetric waveforms backscattered from nonoceanic surfaces.},

	boundary tracking and estimation by considering the boundary as a
	hidden Markov model (HMM) with separated observations collected from
	multiple sensing vehicles. For each vehicle, a tracking algorithm
	is developed based on Page's cumulative sum algorithm (CUSUM), a
	method for change- point detection, so that individual vehicles can
	autonomously track the boundary in a density field with measurement
	noise. Based on the data collected from sensing vehicles and prior
	knowledge of the dynamic model of boundary evolvement, we estimate
	the boundary by solving an optimization problem, in which prediction
	and current observation are considered in the cost function. Examples
	and simulation results are presented to verify the efficiency of
	this approach.},

	with each observation, perhaps supplemented with a partial form of
	Gibbs sampling. The other new approach extends Gibbs sampling for
	these indicators by using a set of auxiliary parameters. These methods
	are simple to implement and are more efficient than previous ways

  abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;This paper introduces a multi-level classification
	framework for the semantic annotation of urban maps as provided by
	a mobile robot. Environmental cues are considered for classification
	at different scales. The first stage considers local scene properties
	using a probabilistic bag-of-words classifier. The second stage incorporates
	contextual information across a given scene (spatial context) and
	across several consecutive scenes (temporal context) via a Markov
	Random Field (MRF). Our approach is driven by data from an onboard
	camera and 3D\&nbsp;laser scanner and uses a combination of visual
	and geometric features. By framing the classification exercise probabilistically
	we take advantage of an information-theoretic bail-out policy when
	evaluating class-conditional likelihoods. This efficiency, combined
	with low order MRFs resulting from our two-stage approach, allows
	us to generate scene labels at speeds suitable for online deployment.
	We demonstrate the virtue of considering such spatial and temporal
	context during the classification task and analyze the performance
	of our technique on data gathered over almost 17\&nbsp;km of track
	through a city.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of learning two-dimensional
	spatial models of gas distributions. To build models of gas distributions
	that can be used to accurately predict the gas concentration at query
	locations is a challenging task due to the chaotic nature of gas
	dispersal. We formulate this task as a regression problem. To deal
	with the specific properties of gas distributions, we propose a sparse
	Gaussian process mixture model, which allows us to accurately represent
	the smooth background signal and the areas with patches of high concentrations.
	We furthermore integrate the sparsification of the training data
	into an EM procedure that we apply for learning the mixture components
	and the gating function. Our approach has been implemented and tested
	using datasets recorded with a real mobile robot equipped with an
	electronic nose. The experiments demonstrate that our technique is
	well-suited for predicting gas concentrations at new query locations
	and that it outperforms alternative and previously proposed methods
	in robotics.},

  abstract = {Driven by the multi-level structure of human intracranial electroencephalogram
	(iEEG) recordings of epileptic seizures, we introduce a new variant
	of a hierarchical Dirichlet Process---the multi-level clustering
	hierarchical Dirichlet Process (MLC-HDP)---that simultaneously clusters
	datasets on multiple levels. Our seizure dataset contains brain activity
	recorded in typically more than a hundred individual channels for
	each seizure of each patient. The MLC-HDP model clusters over channels-types,
	seizure-types, and patient-types simultaneously. We describe this
	model and its implementation in detail. We also present the results
	of a simulation study comparing the MLC-HDP to a similar model, the
	Nested Dirichlet Process and finally demonstrate the MLC-HDP's use
	in modeling seizures across multiple patients. We find the MLC-HDP's
	clustering to be comparable to independent human physician clusterings.
	To our knowledge, the MLC-HDP model is the first in the epilepsy
	literature capable of clustering seizures within and between patients.},
